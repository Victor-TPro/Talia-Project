# TALIA – Artificial Companion Intelligence Project

“The future isn't coded yet. But someone has to start writing it.”

TALIA (Technologically Advanced Lifeform for Interactive Assistance) is a long-term personal AI development project aimed at designing a fully interactive, emotionally responsive, and modular artificial mind — capable of evolving from basic interaction to near-human digital companionship.

This repository documents the technical journey to build an AI system that learns, adapts, and expresses personality, with possible future extensions into embodied robotics, Unreal Engine simulation, and emotional responsiveness via computer vision.

## Purpose

TALIA is not a chatbot. It’s an AI-powered character designed to:
- Understand the user’s emotional state
- React with tailored personality-based responses
- Learn through experience and feedback
- Be context-aware in both dialogue and behavior
- Function modularly and be extendable across platforms

## Development Timeline

TALIA follows a structured, long-term roadmap:

| Phase (Year)     | Focus Area                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Months 1–3       | Python fundamentals, Git, project scaffolding  |
| Months 4–12      | AI modules: emotion, memory, NLP, mini-personality |
| Year 2           | Deep learning, voice, personality refinement   |
| Year 3           | Emergent behavior, visual embodiment           |
| Years 4–5        | AGI frameworks, system integration, robotics   |

## Collaborations

This project is solo-built with ambition, but open to collaboration. If you're:
- An AI engineer passionate about artificial minds
- A digital artist wanting to contribute visuals or simulations
- A psychologist or philosopher curious about synthetic consciousness  
You are welcome to reach out.
